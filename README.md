   1. Parallel Co-ordinates plot: To see how hospital systems (i.e. beds) in a EU countries affect death rate and what is the pattern between median age people, population, and death rate.
   2. Pie Chart plot: Created for the continent of Europe, which will include the percentage of tests carried out by that country compared to the whole of Europe. The more the tests performed in a country, the more reliable the numbers (i.e. total cases) are.
